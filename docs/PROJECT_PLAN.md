# Project Development Plan (Weeks 4-8)

This plan summarizes the week-by-week milestones already captured in
`WEEK4_FINAL.md` and `reports/week5` through `reports/week8`. It is a paperwork
companion to the technical evidence packs and demo artifacts.

## Milestones

- Week 4: Baseline model and dataset split freeze captured in `WEEK4_FINAL.md`.
- Week 5: Robustness analysis and mitigation evidence pack in `reports/week5/`
  (tables, figures, thresholds, error cases).
- Week 6: Experiment plan and model decision documented in
  `reports/week6/week6_experiment_plan.md` and `reports/week6/WEEK6_FINAL.md`.
- Week 7: Ablations, locked evaluation pack, and results notebook in
  `reports/week7/` and `reports/week7/locked_eval_pack/week7_norm_only/`.
- Week 8: Demo packaging and examiner-facing materials summarized in
  `reports/week8/midterm_pack.md` and `reports/week8/changelog.md`.

## Locked items

- Week 7 evaluation pack is frozen at
  `reports/week7/locked_eval_pack/week7_norm_only/` and used by the thesis.

## Remaining work

- Assemble the final thesis with citations and dataset attributions.
- Package appendix materials (tables/figures/error cases) for submission.
